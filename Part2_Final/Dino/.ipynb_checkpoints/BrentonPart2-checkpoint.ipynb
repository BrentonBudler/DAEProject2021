    "In _The labour market and poverty impacts of COVID-19 in South Africa_ Jain _et al_. identified that \"Women, manual workers and those at the bottom half of the income distribution\" were at the greatest risk of losing their employment. Ranchhod and Daniels found in their paper _Labour market dynamics in the time of COVID-19_ that \"Women, African/Blacks, youth and the less educated groups\" were at the greatest disadvantage. We explore each of these contributing factors, to shed light on the effect they had on the loss of labour during the initial stages of COVID-19 in South Africa and determine which factors contributed the most to whether or not an individual would lose their job. The following features from the dataset will be used to represent each of these factors:\n",
    "* **Youth:** We will experiment with models using age as both a continuous and a categorical feature. For statistical purposes the [United Nations](https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/documents/youth/fact-sheets/youth-definition.pdf) defines youth as any individual between the ages of 15-24. We have seen in our EDA that the youngest respondent is 18 years old, so our Youth variable will simply use the <code>age</code> feature and indicate if an individual is older than 24.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Woman:** To indicate whether or not a respondent is a woman, we will one-hot encode the <code>gender</code> feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Income:** In our EDA we identified that the income distribution contains several outliers. To remove these outliers for the modelling process we will drop the top 5% of earners from our data. We will use the <code>take_home_pay_feb</code> feature to capture a respondents income. This feature will also be scaled using minimum-maximum normalization to ensure it's coefficient in the regression model is in a similar scale with the other coefficients. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Education:** In the EDA phase we discovered that the <code>highest_grade</code> variable contains both standard grades (Grade 1 - Grade 12) as well as other qualifications such as the NCV and the NTC. To incorporate this factor into our model we will create a new binary categorical feature, \"Matric\", which indicates whether or not a respondent's highest grade was Grade 12. We also incorporate the <code>tertiary_edu</code> feature to further represent a respondents education. As previously noted, this variable indicates whether the respondent has any tertiary qualifications such as diplomas, certificates or degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **African/Black:** This factor is incorporated by utilizing the <code>race</code> feature from the original dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that because our investigation pertains to the loss of labour, we will be using a subset of our original dataset consisting only of respondents who had some form of work, permanent or part-time, in the beginning of February 2020. These respondents can be selected using the <code>labour_in_feb</code> variable as outlined above. \n",
    "\n",
    "We make the assumption that if a respondent did not answer any of the questions relating to work, resulting in null values in the feature columns, that they were unemployed in the beginning of February 2020. We also assume that if a respondent did not answer the question concerning qualifications, that they do not have a tertiary education. "
