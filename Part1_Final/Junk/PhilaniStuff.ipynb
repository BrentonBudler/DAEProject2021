Firstly, the columns of this dataframe are set to the \"category\" data type, because they all store categorical data. The **total_income_in_apr** was also set to the \"category\" data type for reasons that will be explained in 3.3.2. \n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaning process is similar for all subsequent subsections. First, the **value_counts()** method is ran on a specific column in the swdf dataframe. This method returns the count of all of the unique values in that column. The unique values that are returned are analysed and compared with the kind of values one would expect for that column. If there were any discrepancies between the values that were returned and the kind of values expected, then those values are dealt with in the most appropriate manner. For example, a lot of the columns had meaningless values, such as \"Refused\" or \"Don't know\" for the question that was asked. Those meaningless values were converted to NaN using the **replace_errors()** function. Then, where it was applicable, the rows with NaN values were dropped from the dataframe using the **notna()** function. Where not applicable, those values were **imputed** in the most suitable manner. An example of this can be found in section 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 and will be explained in that section. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the cleaning and wrangling operations have been completed the number of rows $\\geq$ 50 $*$ (number of columns). Therefore, useful inferences can still be made about the data, despite having so many rows dropped because of NaN values."
