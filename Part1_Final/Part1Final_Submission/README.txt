1) Our folder consists of two subfolders, firsly "Notebook" which contains our Jupyter Notebook and the .csv file that is necessary to run the code, and secondly "HTML" which contains the contents as described below.

2) It was requested that we implement a button to toggle between showing/hiding the code. This was implemented using nbconvert. 
We have submitted two .html files, namely Part1_code_hidden.html and Part1_code_showing.html, and each of them has a corresponding folder of other files necessary for the HTML to load correctly.
The purpose of this is so that the marker can view our project with the input blocks(code) either hidden or showing, without having to install nbconvert on their machines.
