    "South Africa has experienced [load shedding](http://loadshedding.eskom.co.za/LoadShedding/Description) for the [past 12 years](https://www.fin24.com/Economy/Eskom/sunday-read-load-shedding-through-the-years-and-how-eskom-has-struggled-to-keep-the-lights-on-20190324). This notebook looks at the impact of coal production on the production of electricity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Is there a significant relationship between coal production and electricity production?\n",
    "\n",

    "Y=B_{0}+B_{1} X\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $B_0$ is an the intercept, $B_{1}$ is the slope (also called the coefficient), $X$ is coal and $Y$ is electricity. If there is a significant relationship between the $X$ and $Y$ variables, the slope will not equal zero. \n",

    "Thus, the **hypothesis** is as follows:\n",

The criteria for our alternative hypothesis was met with linear regression - indicating that there is a significant relationship between the two.
